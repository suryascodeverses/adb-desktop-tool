you're right console worked but it is giving twice. and also i want interactive cli . like i type commands in same place get output or if i paste script it should execute it when i press execute or enter like a normal terminal and check the apk card, yes now it has install button. but why only install?? why aren't there all buttons which existed ealier as i gave you now. install, update, uninstall, etc also list should not vanish if installation completes. but should update with current situation. and if i select same apk twice it should not be doubled. logcat is not showing logs not when device plugged in or if apk installed and i launched it give me all things fixed. and all at once . for every file , give it seperately by typing a file label before starting a new file. if in some file changes are small just tell me where and what to change.
